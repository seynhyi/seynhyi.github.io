        The goal of this game is to give the mafia an unfair advantage to always end up as the winner.

            How to Play:
        </h3>
            <b>
            1. Whoever is directing or leading the game should whisper to the first student that walks 
            into the class and tell them:
            </b> 
            <br><br>“You are the mafia in the game that we will be playing later in class today. 
            As people walk in, you can get rid of at most three people by discretely looking up and then 
            discretely pointing to whoever you want to get rid of. You can start getting rid of people 
            before the game actually starts.”
            <br><br>
            2. Once students are settled and the student leading the game is called to deliver their script, 
            the student should first randomly assign the role of a doctor to a student who doesn’t already 
            have a position. Tell the class, without revealing the name of the person playing the doctor that, 
            
            <br><br>
                “the role of the doctor is to save one person after it is day”.
            <br><br>
            <b>
            3. Explain the meaning of “day” by telling the class, 
        </b>
            <br><br>
                “We are going to play a different version of 
            Mafia. In this game, once I say it is night, everyone should close their eyes as the mafia will be 
            getting rid of one person of their choosing. After the mafia selects the individual they would 
            like to get rid of, I will state the doctor should save the person they believe the mafia has killed.
            After this, I will say it is day, then students can open their eyes and take 15 seconds to guess who 
            they believe the mafia is. The game officially ends when the mafia gets rid of everyone before they 
            are exposed. If you have any questions, ask now or forever hold your peace.”
            <br><br>
            4. After answering any question, tell the class that the game is starting and say “it is night”. 
            Students should follow the instructions said out loud. After the mafia gets rid of everyone, 
            the instructor should say “game over” and then give the doctor and mafia the chance to reveal 
            themselves.
            <br><br>

            <h4>
            (Optional) : Ask students what similarities they can draw between the game and any experience 
            they’ve had or can observe in society.
