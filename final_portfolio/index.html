    <p>
      The author seems to uphold the art of poetry, and this might be 
      due to my lack of understanding but there are few things that, 
      although extremely valid, seem a bit contradictory to me. 
      Although poems and novels are distinct genres--differences that 
      the author clearly points out--space and punctuations are two 
      things that I think a novel can employ to be just as interesting,
      if not more, as a poem or a book of poems. Also, stating that 
      poetry has lost nothing due to it being written and printed 
      instead of spoken or sang suggests some fault in spoken 
      word/poetry(as in, something is lost through spoken 
      word/poetry, which isn't always true as change to 
      the structure and meaning could also be a good thing).
      <br><br>
      The concept of Mail Art is described in a very interesting manner. 
      Personally, I haven't given much thought to the idea of mail 
      art so the production, or characteristics in entails 
      (like the creation of harmony) isn't something I considered. 
      The author seems to be very rigid regarding who a mail artist 
      is/what mail art is, which speaks to their expertise, 
      but also to something I noticed throughout the reading: 
      that the author is very particular, and doesn't really 
      care for assimilation/change.

    <div class = "sticky_h">
    <h3>
      Reading Responses for Week 3 - Martin Paul Eve - 
      Selections from Warez The Infrastructure and Aesthetics of Piracy
    </h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      I initially didn't know what "The Warez Scene" or "the Scene" was 
      so even though I was able to grasp a few concepts regarding the 
      progress of the architecture, I had a better understanding after 
      reading more on what "The Scene" actually is. It is definitely an
      interesting concept, especially with IRC and the Bulletin Board 
      System that existed before FTC. It is interesting to see how even 
      though the internet didn't exist, there were creative ways to still 
      interact, or share information, and eventually inspire the internet. 
      <br><br> 
      One thing that I also noticed was how even though the skills weren't 
      taught, there existed a population that were invested and dedicated 
      enough to learn through observation. Aside inspiring the infrastructure 
      of the internet, there are also a few things I noticed that are reflected 
      in the internet today, including the idea of "unfunny humour". The concept 
      of using specific humour to identify people who are able to relate is 
      something that is widely used today, not necessarily for the same 
      purposes/dangers back then, but to find community on the web

    <!--Week 4-->
    <div class = "sticky_h">
    <h3>
      Reading Responses for Week 4 - Willa Köerner, Laurel Schwulst, & 
      Édouard U - Selections from Creative Independent and Arena How 
      Do You Use the Internet Mindfully
    </h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      I think this might be my favorite so far for multiple reasons. I 
      really appreciate how Schwulst breaks down the components of a 
      website, and the importance of the existing relationship between 
      art and the internet. The metaphors she used to describe what a 
      website could be were very insightful and actually made a lot of 
      sense because I tried to create a website sometime ago even though 
      I didn't have the skills to do so and it ended up being more of a 
      archive or an exhibition. 
      <br><br>
      However, the concept that you can create 
      as many website as you can, and that a website is supposed to be 
      interactive, or only have the current books (the shelves) sort of 
      lift some weight and also cause an artist to constantly improve by 
      creating more works to update the website. Schwulst also brings 
      up an interesting point in emphasizing the need for the internet 
      to be an actual web rather than a cloud. Aside from speaking to 
      the current state of the economy where a micro-body is controls it, 
      it also brings to attention the need for funding of art education, 
      and the affordability of the internet today.

      <br><br>

      This is just something I was curious about: Is there a particular reason 
      for the bird with a black and white filter being the voice of the speech balloon?

    <h3>
      Reading Responses for Week 5 - Alessandro Ludovico & Florian Cramer - 
      Selections from Publishing from Post-Digital-Print
    </h3>
    </div>

    <p>
      I'm a little confused about the DIY print publishing ethic. I understand 
      that such publishers combine digital and analog printing, however, 
      what would be an example? (This is also from the rest of the conclusion) 
      Even though we were given examples of ways we can combine print and digital 
      (the example of the qr code in a book), doesn't it eventually end up being digital?
      <br><br>
      Also, this might be due to my little knowledge of publishing but in the appendix, 
      are the things on the left (paper) supposed to represent mediums(or characteristics of 
      such mediums) through which physical papers are published?

    <!--Week 6-->
    <div class= "sticky_h">
      <h3>
        Reading Responses for Week 6 - Ben Duvall - Selections from New Modernism(s)
      </h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      I really like Ben Duvall's take on graphic design and elements that played and/or 
      continue to play a role in making it universal. Breaking down graphic design 
      first into eras, and further into its elements like the surface and signs is a 
      very interesting concept to me. I've never given much thought to the role texts 
      and the internet as a whole play, but reading this made me realize, using myself 
      as an example, the variety of ways or "surfaces" I am able to express emotions/thoughts/words, 
      etc. I also noticed (and this might be related to Lauren's text) the difference in 
      texts used in memes, tweets, or "quick reads". Not necessarily the content but the 
      way and style in which they are written. 
      <br><br>
      One other thing that stood out to me was the difference between modernism, post-modernism,
      and hypermodernism. I, at least I think I do, understand the concept of modernism, and 
      post-modernism and how they are potential opposites in a sense. However, I'm a little 
      confused by the concept of hypermodernism. Is the difference in the accessibility of 
      hypermodern graphic works?

    <!--Week 7-->
    <div class= "sticky_h">
      <h3>
        Reading Responses for Week 7 - Bojana Coklyat & Shannon Finnegan - Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook
      </h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      Viewing alt-text through the lens of poetry is an interesting take, and from doing 
      a few of the exercises, I think it definitely causes you to be more intentional about 
      your diction and even grammar. This reading seems like an extension of a reading I 
      had in another design class where we discussed the inclusivity of interfaces around us, 
      and the importance of often creating a one-for-one model rather than a one-for-all 
      (along with the concept of design justice). 
      <br><br>
      This speaks to the idea of not just accommodating people, and in this case, through 
      alt texts, but making the web an inclusive and enticing space for all.

      <br>
      Question: At what point does it become too descriptive and inconvenient (perhaps for 
      people who use screen readers)? Because as I was doing writing exercise 2 I noticed 
      that I had a lot of details that may seem cumbersome and even unnecessary
      <br><br>
      (Also (and this might be because of the pdf format), I find it a little ironic that 
      given the subject of the text, using text-to-speech software on this pdf is pretty 
      inconvenient as it reads all the sub-headings on each page before the actual text. 
      In this case, is there a specific way to avoid reading subheadings on the right of
      every page? Or do I have this opinion because using screen readers is not critical 
      to my daily life and this is me speaking from a place of privilege? Or is it a matter 
      of preference?)

  <!--Week 8-->

    <h3>
      Reading Responses for Week 8 - Metahaven - White Night Before A Manifesto & Seth Price - Dispersion
    </h3>
  </div>
    <p>
      I like this take on surfaces, especially the stock market metaphor. It attaches 
      much more meaning to surfaces than I initially thought. Specifically, this quote: 
      "Surfaces extend everywhere, recuperating the potentiality for conﬂicts by offering 
      more space for the uncontested expansion of self-referential opinion. 
      The actual confrontation between adversaries is prevented from taking place, 
      thus suspending the political."
      <br><br>
       I was a little confused with the adversaries 
      that surfaces produce but (please correct me if I'm wrong) I think it refers 
      to the diversity in opinions that we all have based on a surface, and like 
      every space that includes factions, there is bound to be a political conflict. 
      I was just wondering what prevents such adversaries.

        Reading Responses for Week 9 - David Reinfurt - Selections from A *New* Program for Graphic Design
      </h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      I really enjoyed this reading for multiple reasons, specifically because of the
      discussion of perspective. Examples like the running man and illusions help
      us understand perspective better but also allow the reader to now question
      things within their daily lives. I think this also relates a little to last
      week's reading in the sense that rather than a random person attaching value
      to an object, we as the audience or viewers are the ones who are subjects
      of illusion (false or not)
    </p>

    <!--Week 10-->
    <div class= "sticky_h">
      <h3>
        Reading Responses for Week 10 - Josh Harle, Angie Abdila, & Andrew Newman (eds) - Selections from Decolonising the Digital
      </h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      I enjoyed this reading for multiple reasons but the main reason would be 
      how the subject was approached. First, the idea of technology being a cultural 
      practice rather than a universal experience makes a lot of sense. We all have 
      different cultural backgrounds that influence our thinking and beliefs, 
      so if we were presented with a problem, it would be highly influenced by 
      said background. However, usually, solutions that aren't westernized are 
      typically considered not modern and either get criticized or unrecognized 
      as technology.
      <br><br>
      This can be expanded to how different concepts are represented in each culture, 
      and how westernized ideas are the ones commonly recognized as legitimate. 
      Second, I appreciated the fact that in order to describe the colonial 
      control of western science and technology, as well as showcase examples 
      of science and technology as a cultural practice, stories and narratives 
      of Australian Aboriginal peoples were given. Rather than mainly focusing 
      on the western side, the cultural perspective provides more context and 
      a different level of understanding.

      </h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      I didn't know about the master-slave relationship in the context of technology 
      and it does make me uncomfortable, especially since it's being used so often 
      that is accepted as the norm. The explanation of how this came to be speaks 
      to a lot of things: as hinted in last week's reading, this speaks to how 
      silenced minority voices are science and technology, so much so that people 
      are now desensitized to such terms. 
      <br><br>
      Unrelated as well, but it also got me 
      thinking of how ubiquitous gun and violence-related terms are in the English 
      language: make a shot, take a shot, guns in the context of muscular gains, shoot your shot, etc

      Reading Responses for Week 12 - Hito Steyerl - Why Games Or Can Art Workers Think & Manuel Arturo Abreu - Incalculable Loss
    </h3>
    </div>

    <p>
      I was a little confused yet intrigued by this reading for multiple reasons. I think comparing life and constructed ideals to a game and distancing us from reality achieves the goal of helping readers better understand how ironically digitized we've become. It is easier to judge and assess something when we are viewers or audiences, rather than when we're participants.
      <br><br>
      Aside digitized humans, the reading--at least my interpretation of it--speaks to socially constructed aspects. Following our friends and what they do in order to avoid being a sore thumb, or drifting towards something based our, or society's perception of beauty could either support or contradict the fact that we're so digitized. Support in the sense that as a computer follows and communicates with other computers, so are we when we follow guidelines or notions defined by society. Contradict in the sense that unlike computers, we are the ones who create such guidelines and decide whether to stick with it or not

    <!--Week 13-->
    <div class= "sticky_h">
    <h3>
      Reading Responses for Week 13 - Jasia Reichardt ed - Selections from Cybernetic Serendipity the Computer and the Arts
    </h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      I found both reading pretty interesting, mainly based on the titles initially. For the CIPC, the entire concept was really intriguing and reminds me of the red lines/movement you see when you close your eye, especially after looking directly at the sun. I wonder if that inspired the project in any way.
      <br><br>
      I looked up the Three Graces project by Ken Cos simply because the image in the text wasn't clear. I don't know if the placements of the other two are key but the placement of Amor in the middle seems to speak to how fundamental love specifically is as the bridge between human emotions. This is also amplified by the double-helix structure which is popularly known as the structure of DNA.

    <!--Week 14-->
    <div class= "sticky_h">
    <h3>
      Reading Responses for Week 14 - Boris Groys - Art on the Internet & Christine T. Wolfe - Computing in Crip Time from Logic Issue 16 Clouds
    </h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      I really enjoyed the Computing in Crip Time article. 
      It is interesting to see how changes in our bodies cause us to interact 
      differently with our environment and vice versa. I also believe that 
      while there may be similarities, no two people go through the world 
      exactly the same, which speaks to the importance of designs reflecting 
      lived/learned experiences of multiple people. Although as seen in the 
      article, there are ways to compromise, like recording meetings, and 
      being able to join with an "audio only" option, not everyone with 
      similar inabilities can afford to do so (this can be due to their job, 
      the hierarchy at work, their boss's lack of understanding, etc).  
      <br><br>
      Therefore, it is important that designs are created in the first place to accommodate different experiences, and it is impossible for one person or a group of people who share extremely similar experiences to cover all circumstances.

    <!--Week 15-->
    <div class= "sticky_h">
    <h3>
      Reading for Week 15 - Alyssa Battistoni - A Repair Manual for Spaceship Earth from Logic Issue 9 Nature
    </h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      It was quite interesting to see the role that technology plays or can play. 
      In "A Repair Manual for Spaceship Earth from Logic Issue 9 Nature", I like the idea 
      that seeks to solve the general problem of global warming/climate change because 
      there isn't enough time for lifestyle changes to be made to make resources last 
      longer for the entire population. It is interesting to see that using technology 
      might cost less than finding a completely new substitution because it goes along 
      with the current state of the market: "naturally-produced" goods tend to cost 
      more than genetically-modified products due to mass consumption.
      <br><br>
      I think this might also end up being a problem for using technology as an answer: the effects 
      might not last long due to the constant increase in demand(general population). 
      I don't know what the solution for this might be because reducing the average 
      individual to pick up recycling/healthier environmental habits simultaneously,
      doesn't cancel out the amount of air pollution by companies/such technology will 
      be causing.
