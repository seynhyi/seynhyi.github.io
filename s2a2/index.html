                          It’s the catching that’s the problem; illegal dumping is often done 
                          at night and in low-traffic areas, where dumpers know they’re out of law enforcement’s 
                          eyeshot. Hence the frequent calls by residents for camera installation: If you can capture 
                          dumping on camera, then you have a better chance at catching those responsible.
